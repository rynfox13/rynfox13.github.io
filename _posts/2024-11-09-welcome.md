I'm Kathryn Fox, a technical writer and site reliability engineer with a passion for writing useful documentation for projects. I'm starting this site to showcase my writing and technology skills, especially considering all of my work to this point is hidden behind Non-Disclosure Agreements. I will always hold the confidentiality of my clients in the highest regard.

To give a brief summary of my background, I have over 20 years in Information Technology, including software development, systems engineering, networking, systems administration, and site reliability engineering. I have worked at **Google**, **Twitter**, **Grubhub**, and **SiriusXM**, to name a few, and have worked in companies of all sizes.

For this site, I will be mixing my backgrounds to create monthly posts on various topics, depending on what I may find interesting. There will be posts on technology, science, science fiction, and other topics.

So, welcome, take a look around, and I hope you find inspiration here.
