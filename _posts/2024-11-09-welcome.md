I'm Kathryn Fox, a technical writer and site reliability engineer with a passion for writing useful documentation for projects. In addition to writing, I have an extensive information technology background, including working at **Google**, **Twitter**, **Grubhub** and **SiriusXM**. Beyond these well known companies, I have worked at and with startups, so I have experience working with companies of all sizes.

Here, I blend my technical and creative writing backgrounds to share my thoughts on technology, security, technical writing, music and other topics.

Take a look around, and I hope you find inspiration here.
