Hello! I'm Kathryn Fox, a **Site Reliability Engineer** and **technical writer** with a rich blend of skills in **software development**, **security engineering**, and **educational content creation**. Over my career, I've worked with companies like **Google**, **Twitter**, **Grubhub**, and **SiriusXM**, focusing on making resilient systems, optimizing performance, and creating clear, actionable documentation. Here’s a snapshot of my experience:

## Engineering & Security Expertise

- **SRE & DevOps**: I have a proven track record in building and managing fault-tolerant, event-driven infrastructure, with extensive experience in AWS, GCP, DataDog, and orchestration tools.
- **Application Security**: I designed vulnerability management solutions and secure infrastructures, including CloudFlare WAF and complex configurations to enhance security and reduce fraud.
- **Programming & Automation**: I developed tools and services in **Python**, **C++**, and **Bash** to optimize system reliability, orchestrate services, and implement SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs.

## Writing & Education

- **Technical Documentation**: I am skilled at transforming complex technical processes into user-friendly documentation for diverse audiences. A sample of my technical writing is available in my [Technical Writer Portfolio](https://rynfox13.github.io/technical-writing-portfolio/).
- **Creative & Academic Writing**: With an MFA in Creative Writing and experience as an English instructor, I bring both a technical and creative edge to my work, crafting content that’s precise yet engaging.

I’m passionate about mentorship, continuous learning, and fostering a collaborative environment. Feel free to explore my repositories for examples of my work in engineering, technical documentation, and educational content.
