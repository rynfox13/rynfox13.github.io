Hello! I'm Kathryn Fox, a **Site Reliability Engineer** and **technical writer** with a rich blend of skills in **software development**, **security engineering**, and **educational content creation**. Over my career, I've worked with companies like **Google**, **Twitter**, **Grubhub**, and **SiriusXM**, focusing on making resilient systems, optimizing performance, and creating clear, actionable documentation. In my freetime, I write science fiction and produce electronic music.
